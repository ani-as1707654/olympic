    <h3>Toyota’s CUE: The Machine That Never Misses</h3>
    <p>
      Meet Toyota’s CUE — a humanoid robot built by Toyota engineers in their spare time, 
      and one of the most accurate shooters in basketball history. With no emotion and no fatigue, 
      CUE earned a Guinness World Record for the most consecutive free throws ever made by a robot. 
      It’s not just tech on display — it’s a blend of passion, precision, and serious ball skills. 
      Watching CUE shoot feels less like a gimmick and more like a glimpse into basketball’s automated future.

      <h3>AI Grand Slam</h3>
      <p>
        In this futuristic twist on pro tennis, humanoid robots take to the court 
        with real-time vision, agility, and predictive shot control. Powered by AI 
        and reinforced learning, these robots aren't just playing — they’re competing 
        at professional level speed, pushing boundaries of motion and reaction time. 
        Could we soon see cyborgs in Grand Slam finals?

    <h3>Battle Bots Arena</h3>
    <p>
      It’s not just fists flying anymore. In this underground-style ring, AI-powered boxing robots 
      square up with footwork, dodges, and punches that mimic real athletes. Built to take hits and 
      give them back harder, these machines are trained on hours of professional fight footage. 
      They don't get tired, and they never back down. 
      It's brutal, fast, and fascinating—where steel meets instinct.

   <h3>Triple Serve Challenge</h3>
<p>
  Three players. One robot. What sounds like an unfair match turns into a jaw-dropping rally. 
  The bot takes on a trio of human opponents with sharp reflexes and flawless timing. 
  Designed for speed and adaptability, it tracks every ball with laser focus — holding its own 
  against fast serves and tricky angles. Whether you call it tennis or something else, 
  this is pure proof that robots are more than ready for the court.
